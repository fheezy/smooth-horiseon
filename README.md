# Smooth Horiseon

## I was hired by a marketing agency that ideally wanted their codebased to be more optimized for accessibility. The problem on the codesheet was that evyerhting was "div" so it was hard to claify for someone with a disability such as seeing could fully understand what is going on. So what i did was clean up the codebase and added sections to clarify what does along with leaving comments for the next developer to understand what i did. During this project i learned more about semantics, tags, css style sheet and ways to make it more organized.

## Table of Contents

## Installation
-refactor the code from git, coppied the html and uploaded it in VS code, changed the layout of my VS code and had the style.css besides it so i was able to look at both when needed too. Cleaned the html sheet from top to down, matching the style.css sheet as well. Next i left comments, i used terminal to commmit, used git to push orgin main, git status, added to git.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
